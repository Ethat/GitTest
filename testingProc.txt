First test: What are the steps to perform a "simple database reboot" -- is it, for example, logging into Windows Server, starting SQL Server Management Studio and restarting SQL Server? Or, from Services control panel, restarting MSSQLSERVER service? How do I know that Townsend is "online", for example, access to a TDE-encrypted database, which has the DEK encrypted by an AKM key? (In which case, the restart of SQL Server would guarantee that the Key Connection provider must contact AKM Server when the database is accessed for the first time).
